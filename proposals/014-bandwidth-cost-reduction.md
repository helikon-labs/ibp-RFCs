# RFC 014 – IBP Bandwidth Cost Reduction Measure

## Summary

This RFC is a follow-up to [RFC-013 PR](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/13) regarding hardware pricing reductions, and it proposes lowering bandwidth costs for all members as well, in order to guarantee a 6-month runway for IBP with DOT at $2 USD. The targets, as with RFC-013, are to:

> ...reduce Treasury outflow, extend sustainability, and strengthen our commercial positioning with Parity, W3F, and other ecosystem clients.

## Proposed New Pricing (Effective December 2025):

| Region | Current Price per GB | Suggested Price per GB |
|---|---:|---:|
| Central Africa | `$0.1540` | `$0.1324` |
| Asia | `$0.1200` | `$0.1032` |
| Europe | `$0.1050` | `$0.0903` |
| Middle East | `$0.1300` | `$0.1118` |
| Oceania | `$0.1520` | `$0.1307` |
| North America | `$0.1050` | `$0.0903` |
| Central America | `$0.1540` | `$0.1324` |
| South America | `$0.1700` | `$0.1462` |

## Impact

This roughly 14% reduction lowers the total monthly bandwidth payout from $111K down to $95K, an, when combined with the measures proposed in RFC-013, brings the total monthly burn rate down to $190K. With the current balance of 571K DOT and a conservative DOT rate of $2, this would provide IBP with a 6-month runway, during which the necessary restructuring and preparations for the next top-up can take place.

## Rationale

The reasoning for this RFC is the same as that of RFC-013. Please refer to the [RFC-013 PR](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/13) for details.
